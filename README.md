# Franz-Foto-Archiv

Web application to upload and view images.

### Background:
This app was created as a Matura-Project and was designed to be an Archiv for "Old-Photographies" that have a story attached to them.
I choose to make this project because my great-great-grandfather was one of the first professional photographs in South Tyrol and had made a copy of nearly every photography. 
So my grandpa needed a place to store all of his images and to remember the stories behind them that he could remember/researched or got told by others.


### Functionallity:
- upload images with a description, the author, copyright a title...
- manage and search for images
- view images as a slideshow and with their story displayed
